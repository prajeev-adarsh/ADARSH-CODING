def seriesSum(n):
    # Calculate the sum of the series using the formula
    series_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    return series_sum

# Example usage:
# n = 5
# print(seriesSum(n))

#Explanation:
#We use the formula for the sum of the series, which is n times n plus 1, divided by 2.
#We ensure integer division by using //.
#The function returns the calculated sum.
